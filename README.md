ðŸŒŸ About Me

Hi there! I'm a digital fashion designer and web developer with a pretty unique blend of skills. I started with a BA in Fashion Design, added an MA in Design with a focus on speculative design & digital/virtual fashion, and then pursued a BS in Computer Science to round out my expertise. My journey has been driven by a desire to blend my love for design with my passion for tech. 

ðŸ’» Tech Skills

Frontend Development: I'm currently getting my hands dirty with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and practicing React to add it to my toolkit.

Backend Knowledge: I've dabbled in Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, which helps me understand the bigger picture of web development.

Digital Fashion Design: Skilled in Clo3D and Blender for crafting digital fashion pieces, and using Spark AR for creating engaging AR experiences.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Digital fashion for me is about innovation and sustainability, exploring how we can redefine fashion in the digital realm. It's a space I'm passionate about, constantly learning and experimenting.

ðŸš€ Projects & Collaboration

My GitHub is in the works of becoming a showcase of my journey and experiments in web development and creative coding. It might not be packed yet, but I'm committed to filling it with interesting and meaningful projects.

I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and learn more about web development. Whether you have a project in mind or just want to say hi, I'm all ears!
